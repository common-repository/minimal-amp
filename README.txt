An incredibly minimal Accelerated Mobile Pages implementation, courtesy of Postlight's Mercury service. Just activate and go!

== Description ==

Minimal AMP uses the Mercury web parser from Postlight to offer an AMP compliant version of every post on your site.

Leaning on the WordPress project's philosophy of "decisions, not options", there is no settings page for Minimal AMP. If you need something that's more robust or customizable, you can get as fiddly as you want with [AMP for WP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/).

**Note:** All AMP pages are generated and loaded through [Postlight's free 3rd party service](https://mercury.postlight.com/amp-converter/). This means that all AMP traffic for your site will be directed to (and hosted by) Postlight's servers.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Clear any caches on your site.
